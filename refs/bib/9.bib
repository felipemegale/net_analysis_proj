abstract = {In this article, we focus on fake news detection task and aim to automatically identify the fake news from vast amount of social media posts. To date, many approaches have been proposed to detect fake news, which includes traditional learning methods and deep learning-based models. However, there are three existing challenges: (i) How to represent social media posts effectively, since the post content is various and highly complicated; (ii) how to propose a data-driven method to increase the flexibility of the model to deal with the samples in different contexts and news backgrounds; and (iii) how to fully utilize the additional auxiliary information (the background knowledge and multi-modal information) of posts for better representation learning. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Knowledge-aware Multi-modal Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks (KMAGCN) to capture the semantic representations by jointly modeling the textual information, knowledge concepts, and visual information into a unified framework for fake news detection. We model posts as graphs and use a knowledge-aware multi-modal adaptive graph learning principal for the effective feature learning. Compared with existing methods, the proposed KMAGCN addresses challenges from three aspects: (1) It models posts as graphs to capture the non-consecutive and long-range semantic relations; (2) it proposes a novel adaptive graph convolutional network to handle the variability of graph data; and (3) it leverages textual information, knowledge concepts and visual information jointly for model learning. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets and superior results demonstrate the effectiveness of KMAGCN compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},
