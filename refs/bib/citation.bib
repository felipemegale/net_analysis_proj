    abstract = "Nowadays, fake news detection, which aims to verify whether a news document is trusted or fake, has become urgent and important. Most existing methods rely heavily on linguistic and semantic features from the news content, and fail to effectively exploit external knowledge which could help determine whether the news document is trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph neural model called CompareNet, which compares the news to the knowledge base (KB) through entities for fake news detection. Considering that fake news detection is correlated with topics, we also incorporate topics to enrich the news representation. Specifically, we first construct a \textit{directed heterogeneous document graph} for each news incorporating topics and entities. Based on the graph, we develop a \textit{heterogeneous graph attention network} for learning the topic-enriched news representation as well as the contextual entity representations that encode the semantics of the news content. The contextual entity representations are then compared to the corresponding KB-based entity representations through a carefully designed \textit{entity comparison network}, to capture the consistency between the news content and KB. Finally, the topic-enriched news representation combining the entity comparison features is fed into a fake news classifier. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompareNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

abstract = {Nowadays, fake news is widely spreading in various media, and this fake information is causing serious damage in many areas. Therefore, there is an increasing need to accurately detect fake news to prevent such damage. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses graph and summarization techniques for fake news detection. Our proposed method represents the relationship of all sentences in a graph structure to accurately understand the context information of the document. Accordingly, the relationship between sentences in the graph is calculated as a score through the attention mechanism. Then, the summarization technique is used to reflect the sentence subject information in the graph update process. Our proposed method shows better performance than Karimi’s and BERT based models by approximately 10.34%p and 3.72%p, respectively.}

abstract = {In this article, we focus on fake news detection task and aim to automatically identify the fake news from vast amount of social media posts. To date, many approaches have been proposed to detect fake news, which includes traditional learning methods and deep learning-based models. However, there are three existing challenges: (i) How to represent social media posts effectively, since the post content is various and highly complicated; (ii) how to propose a data-driven method to increase the flexibility of the model to deal with the samples in different contexts and news backgrounds; and (iii) how to fully utilize the additional auxiliary information (the background knowledge and multi-modal information) of posts for better representation learning. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Knowledge-aware Multi-modal Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks (KMAGCN) to capture the semantic representations by jointly modeling the textual information, knowledge concepts, and visual information into a unified framework for fake news detection. We model posts as graphs and use a knowledge-aware multi-modal adaptive graph learning principal for the effective feature learning. Compared with existing methods, the proposed KMAGCN addresses challenges from three aspects: (1) It models posts as graphs to capture the non-consecutive and long-range semantic relations; (2) it proposes a novel adaptive graph convolutional network to handle the variability of graph data; and (3) it leverages textual information, knowledge concepts and visual information jointly for model learning. We have conducted extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets and superior results demonstrate the effectiveness of KMAGCN compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {The proliferation of fake news on social media has the probability to bring an unfavorable impact on public opinion and social development. Many efforts have been paid to develop effective detection and intervention algorithms in recent years. Most of the existing propagation-based fake news detection methods focus on static networks and assume the whole information propagation network structure is accessible before performing learning algorithms. However, in real-world information diffusion networks, new nodes and edges constantly emerge. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel temporal propagation-based fake news detection framework, which could fuse structure, content semantics, and temporal information. In particular, our model can model temporal evolution patterns of real-world news as the graph evolving under the setting of continuous-time dynamic diffusion networks. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art fake news detection methods.}

abstract = {In recent years, the growing success of social media has led to a proliferation of social information such as customer product reviews and product ratings in electronic markets. While this information can serve as a quality signal and help consumers to better assess the quality of goods before purchase, its impact on consumer decision-making also incentivizes sellers to game the system by creating fake data in favor of specific goods in order to mislead consumers deliberately. Consequently, consumers could make suboptimal decisions or choose to disregard social information altogether. Although few studies have been devoted to identifying fake quantitative social information such as fake product rankings and ratings, tracing and examining the effects of such fake information on consumers' actual financial decision-making over time has thus far received only little research attention. In this exploratory study, we assess the effects of non-genuine social information on consumers' decision-making in the context of reward-based crowdfunding. Specifically, we capture unnatural peaks in the number of Facebook Likes that a specific crowdfunding campaign receives on the platform Kickstarter and observe subsequent campaign performance. Our results show that fake Facebook Likes have a very short-term positive effect on the number of backers funding the respective crowdfunding campaign. However, this short-term peak is followed by an immediate, sharp drop in the number of backers funding the campaign reaching levels that are lower than prior to the occurrence of the non-genuine social information, leading to a total negative effect over time. We further reveal circumstances that foster this artificial manipulation of quality signals, including market and campaign characteristics. Key implications for research and practice are discussed.}

abstract = {With the widespread use of online social media, we have witnessed that fake news causes enormous distress and inconvenience to people's social life. Although previous studies have proposed rich machine learning methods for identifying fake news in social media, the task of detecting fake news in emerging news events/domains remains a challenging problem due to the wide range of news topics on social media as well as the evolution and variation of fake news contents in the web. In this study, we propose an approach which we term “domain-adversarial and graph-attention neural network” (DAGA-NN) model to address the challenge. Its main advantage is that, in a text environment with multiple events/domains, only partial domain sample data are needed to train the model to achieve accurate cross-domain fake news detection in those domains with few (or even no) samples, which makes up for the limitations of traditional machine learning in fake news detection tasks due to news content evolution or cross-domain identification (where there is no sample data). Extensive experiments were conducted on two multimedia datasets of Twitter and Weibo, and the results showed that the proposed model was very effective in detecting fake news across events/domains.}
